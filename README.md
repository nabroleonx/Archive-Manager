This is a **simple archive manager** with an easy to use gui that will let you extract and compress `.zip` files. 
_You won't need third party archiving tool like **winrar** or **7zip** to extract zip files.

The GUI is made with the Gooey python module._

[Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) is a Python GUI program development framework based on the wxPython GUI library, which is used in a similar way to Python's built-in CLI development library, argparse, where console programs can be quickly converted to GUI applications with a single line of code.

## Installation mode
```python
pip install Gooey

```

## Usage

It is really simple. There are two tabs: Extract and Compress. Select what you want want and hit start.
